Data Mining Practice #4  
Consider data set ‘pima.txt’ to perform the following tasks.  
* Perform equal-width with ten bins and the entropy-based discretization on the continuous attributes.  Then apply the naïve Bayesian classifier when the evaluation method is 5-fold cross validation.
* Apply the k-nearest neighbor with k = 5 when the evaluation method is 5-fold cross validation.  The classification approach is either majority voting or distance-weighted voting.
